==========
12. Go up one directory so that you're in ~/mtec1002-lab-03.
[NO OUTPUT]
----------



==========
13. Try removing the directory called my_files using rmdir.

Write out the command that you used and what happened.
----------
ent-v314-011:mtec1002-lab-03 student$ rmdir my_files
rmdir: my_files: Directory not empty


==========
14. Try removing the directory called my_files using rm.

Write out the command that you used and what happened.
----------
nt-v314-011:mtec1002-lab-03 student$ rm my_files
rm: my_files: is a directory


==========
15. MAKE SURE YOU'RE IN THE mtec1002-lab-03 directory!  

Force the removal of the directory and files using the -rf flag

$ rm -rf my_files
----------
ent-v314-011:mtec1002-lab-03 student$ rm -rf my_files
ent-v314-011:mtec1002-lab-03 student$ ls
books	logs	web


==========
16. There's a txt file version of a book located in the mtec1002-lab-03 folder.  It is in the following directory if you're in the lab folder:

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command called cat on the file to show its contents. 

Describe what happened below.
----------
Cat displayed Nicolo Machiavelli's The Prince in the terminal.

==========
17. That was a lot of text.  Let's find ways to limit it.  Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use the command, head, on the file to show the contents of the beginning of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
ent-v314-011:mtec1002-lab-03 student$ head books/other/pg1232.txt
Title: The Prince

==========
18. Using the same file again!

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use tail on the file to show the contents of the end of the file.  

Write the command that you used below.  Write the last line of the output below (it should be the title).
----------
ent-v314-011:mtec1002-lab-03 student$ tail books/other/pg1232.txt
Title: The Prince


==========
19. Using the same file...

books/other/pg1232.txt

Use less and more on the file to show the contents of the file.  Try pressing spacebar and/or q afterwards.

Write the command that you used below.  Describe what spacebar and q does after using either less or more.
----------
ent-v314-011:mtec1002-lab-03 student$ less books/other/pg1232.txt
ent-v314-011:mtec1002-lab-03 student$ more books/other/pg1232.txt
The commands displayded The Prince in the terminal. Spacebar made ther terminal move an entire page downward and Q quit the file and erased it from the terminal if in less, but more made the file be saved to the terminal


==========
20. Describe what situations you would use the following commands for viewing files: less, more, cat, tail, head

(Some characteristics that may help your description might be the length of the file, whether or not you'd like to read the whole thing... or just the beginning or end, etc.)
----------
Less: Looking at a document quickly and not wanting it to clutter your terminal but in a command mode that allows you to move up and down pages, as well search for something specific.
More: Looking at a document for long periods of time using it constantly as a refrence on your terminal but in a command mode that allows you to move up and down pages, as well search for something specific.
Cat: Puts the file completely on your terminal with no valid commands on how to control it 
Tail: Only displays the bottom of a file in case what you immediately need is on the bottom of the .txt 
head: Only displays the top of a file in case what you immediately need is on the top of the .txt 

==========
21.  How many words are in pg1232.txt?  What command did you use to determine the word count?
